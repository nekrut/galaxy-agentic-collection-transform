Research Galaxy's apply rules DSL in detail and create RESEARCH_APPLY_RULES.md.

Read PROBLEM_AND_GOAL.md to understand the context and objectives.

Fetch and analyze:
1. https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/5819 - The PR introducing apply rules
2. https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/util/rules_dsl_spec.yml - The rules DSL specification

Provide detailed documentation on:
- Available rule operations
- Rule syntax and structure
- How to compose rules
- Use cases for each rule type
- Examples from the PR and spec
- How rules transform collections

This is critical documentation - the apply rules DSL is a powerful tool for collection manipulation and needs thorough understanding.

Output: Create/update RESEARCH_APPLY_RULES.md with very detailed rules DSL documentation.
