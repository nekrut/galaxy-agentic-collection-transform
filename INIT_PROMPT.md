This prompt was fed to Claude's SONNET model on 12/2/2025 using claude code to bootstrap this repository:

I want to automate the creation of a Claude command (the final artifact of this repository) from a set of research markdowns and additional user-provided thoughts and insights. I want to decompose this into a bunch of steps that gather research first - each in turn implemented as a Claude command within the repository (e.g. research-training, research-api, research-tests, research-tools).

I work on the Galaxy project and I've had users use Claude contact the Galaxy Dataset Collection API directly and filter, split up, re-organzie collections. I'm very impressed that Claude can do this so aptly - but we lose reproducibility when Claude does this - it is as if Claude just downloaded a dataset, modified  it, and re-uploaded it and continued an analysis. It makes workflow extraction impossible and introduces stocastic steps in the analysis. But we have all sorts of tools and techniques inside of Galaxy that can do this is repeatable ways by avoiding direct, arbitrary collection creation. I'd like to build a slash command that we can teach about all the techniques and let Claude decide how to do this in a more reproducible and "Galactic" way. Can you articulate the high-level problem and the desired goal into a document called PROBLEM_AND_GOAL.md.

To reach that final goal I'd like to create some intermediate documents using Claude slash commands that we can re-trigger as our documentation improves and as we polish the final result of this project. Each slash command should read PROBLEM_AND_GOAL.md to guide the research.

I'd like RESEARCH_SUMMARY_TRAINING.md to be a summary of Galaxy training network material on this topic created by a new Claude slash command called research-training.md. I'd like you to read and summarize https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/collections/tutorial.html and https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/upload-rules/tutorial.html and https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/upload-rules-advanced/tutorial.html when that command is invoked.

I'd like RESEARCH_TOOLS.md to read Galaxy's collection operation tools and summarize what operations are available and how to use them. I would like this research done by a Claude slash command called research-tools.md. It should read in a Galaxy directory or default to ~/workspace/galaxy and should find all the XML files in lib/galaxy/tools and summarize them. They might not all be relevant but most of them will be.

I'd like RESEARCH_API.md to summarize Galaxy's tools API - this should be generated by slash command called research-api.md. Same input and default. It should read in lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/api/tools.py and lib/galaxy_test/api/test_tools.py and https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/bioblend-api/slides-plain.html and summarize how to use the tool calling API.

I'd like RESEARCH_TESTS.md to be created from a research-tests.md claude slash command that reads in RESEARCH_TOOLS.md and RESEARCH_API.md and then rereads test_tools.py from Galaxy and summarize how to use collection operations and the apply rules in particular.

I'd like RESEARCH_APPLY_RULES.md to created from a research-apply-rules.md slash command. This command should read in https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/5819, https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/util/rules_dsl_spec.yml - and provide a very detailed how what rules are available.
